# Preface (It's all very much a WIP)

> Programs accept data and produce data. Designing a program requires a
> thorough understanding of data; a good program reflects the shape of the data
> it deals with.

Ah, the good ol' preface for The Little Schemer has always been a strong source
of inspiration for the way I think about programs and, well, about data too.
It is a broadly accepted truth, with a lot of nuances within. The key being to
what degree with model the world around us.

_The goal of this book is to teach the reader to think recursively and
concurrently_. To do this, we must choose a language to communicate with each
other. We could use a natural language, like Swedish; we could use some formal
mathematics, and speak TLA+; or we could use a programming language, like
Erlang.

In the spectrum from natural languages to formal mathematics, it seems that a
programming language would fall in the right place: it can be succint without
being cryptic, and, while it has rules to see its outcomes, we have compilers
and interpreters to help us understand what these outcomes in fact are. What is
more, these tools become our assistants and allies in the learning of the
language and exploring of solutions to problems.

Perhaps the best programming language for learning to think concurrently is
Erlang.

## How to read this book

This book expects you to be comfortable reading and understanding English,
recognizing words, letters, and visual patterns. That's all, really. And to be
patient.

You may feel the need to rush through the frames in this book. Instead, try to
read slowly. If you don't fully understand one chapter, you will understand
the next one even less. 

## Acknowledgments

First of all, to Daniel P. Friedman for his work on The Little Schemer series,
which has been foundational to me as a programmer in a number of ways.

I'd like to also thank everyone that took time out of your days to read these
drafts and share your honest feedback with me.
